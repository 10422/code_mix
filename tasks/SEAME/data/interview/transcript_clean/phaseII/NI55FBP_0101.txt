NI55FBP_0101 2331453 2338560 EN and the floor are all cobbled stone pathways so basically it looks the same except that there are french words
NI55FBP_0101 2338560 2342895 EN but then as we drive down further down into the city then i realised

NI55FBP_0101 2376932 2380521 EN and then that is my mother who doesn't like to walk in the cold at all
NI55FBP_0101 2381293 2387997 EN and then yah we reached the hotel and then we unpacked everything and we went the first place we went was champs-Élysées

NI55FBP_0101 2423381 2431864 EN then they were in paris and then they were singing this champs-Élysées song at first i thought is because their pronounciation is weird and then i asked my friend samantha and samantha was like
NI55FBP_0101 2431864 2435214 EN no it is pronounced as champs-Élysées don't you know
